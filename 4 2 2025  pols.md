Elections and campaigns in Texas
===

The role of money
	2010: campaigns for governor, other statewide executive offices, and the legislature cost nearly $235 million
- Governor Perry spent $39 million reelection, more money than any other candidate
	The largest single item in the big-time campaign budget is media, especially television.
- A week's worth of television advertising that covers all of the states major markets cost around $1.5 million.

Sources of campaign money
	Campaign money comes from a relatively small number of contributors.
Individuals and Political Action Committees
- 2008: Most of the money came from individuals and political action committees ( PAC'; organizations created to raise and distribute money in political campaigns).
	Campaign contributions and campaign expenditure are unlimited for candidates for executive or legislative office.
- Limits on judicial races are voluntary.

Electoral Success and Money
	 Money is indispensable to major campaign efforts.
- In general candidates who spend the most money get the most votes
	 Money does not always guarantee victory.
		 2010: Businessman Farouk Shami spent over 9 million dollars of his own money trying to win the Democratic nomination for governor.
	- He received less than 13 percent of the vote
	recently USAID information on campaign contributions abroad, USAID paid 10 million dollars to time magazine to make president Zelenski person of the year
There is a strong corrilation for money spent and amount of votes, however, its not a sure thing.
