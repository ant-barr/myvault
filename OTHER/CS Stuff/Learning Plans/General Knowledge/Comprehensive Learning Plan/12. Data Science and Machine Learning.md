- **Machine Learning Basics**:
    - _Supervised Learning_: Training models on labeled data (e.g., regression, classification).
    - _Unsupervised Learning_: Finding hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
    - _Reinforcement Learning_: Learning optimal actions through trial and error.
- **Key Algorithms**:
    - _Linear Regression_: Predicting continuous outcomes.
    - _Decision Trees and Random Forests_: Modeling decisions and classifications.
    - _Neural Networks_: Building models inspired by the human brain for complex pattern recognition.
    - _Support Vector Machines (SVM)_: Classifying data with maximum margin.
    - _K-Means Clustering_: Grouping data points based on similarity.
    - _Principal Component Analysis (PCA)_: Reducing data dimensionality.
- **Model Evaluation and Tuning**:
    - _Cross-Validation_: Testing model performance on unseen data.
    - _Hyperparameter Tuning_: Optimizing model parameters for better performance.
    - _Overfitting and Underfitting_: Balancing model complexity to generalize well.
- **Big Data Technologies**:
    - _Hadoop and Spark_: Processing large-scale datasets in distributed environments.
    - _NoSQL Databases_: Handling unstructured and semi-structured data.
    - _Data Warehousing_: Storing and analyzing large volumes of data.
- **Deep Learning**:
    - _Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)_: For image recognition and processing.
    - _Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)_: For sequence data like time series and text.
    - _Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)_: For generating new data samples.
- **Data Visualization**:
    - _Matplotlib, Seaborn_: Python libraries for creating visual representations of data.
    - _Tableau, Power BI_: Tools for building interactive data dashboards.
