### Summary

Cloud Computing involves delivering computing services—servers, storage, databases, networking, software—over the internet ("the cloud"). This allows for flexible resources, faster innovation, and economies of scale. Understanding cloud computing is crucial for modern software development, deployment, and scaling.

### Core Concepts

- **Cloud Service Models**:
    - _Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)_: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
    - _Platform as a Service (PaaS)_: Offers hardware and software tools over the internet.
    - _Software as a Service (SaaS)_: Delivers software applications over the internet.
- **Cloud Providers**:
    - _AWS (Amazon Web Services)_: Leading cloud service provider with a vast range of services.
    - _Azure_: Microsoft’s cloud platform for building, testing, and deploying applications.
    - _Google Cloud Platform (GCP)_: Google’s suite of cloud computing services.
- **Virtualization**:
    - _VMs (Virtual Machines)_: Simulated computing environments.
    - _Containers_: Lightweight virtualization for packaging applications (e.g., Docker).
    - _Kubernetes_: Container orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.
- **Cloud Storage**:
    - _Object Storage_: Store and manage large amounts of unstructured data (e.g., S3).
    - _Block Storage_: Provides raw storage for running applications (e.g., EBS).
    - _File Storage_: Managed file storage for use with EC2 instances.
- **Serverless Computing**:
    - _Function as a Service (FaaS)_: Execute code in response to events without managing servers (e.g., AWS Lambda).
    - _Backend as a Service (BaaS)_: Cloud services that handle the backend for applications (e.g., Firebase).
- **Cloud Security**:
    - _Identity and Access Management (IAM)_: Control access to resources in the cloud.
    - _Encryption_: Protecting data at rest and in transit.
    - _Compliance_: Ensuring cloud deployments meet regulatory standards.
- **DevOps and Automation**:
    - _CI/CD Pipelines_: Continuous integration and delivery pipelines for automating deployments.
    - _Infrastructure as Code (IaC)_: Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code (e.g., Terraform).
    - _Monitoring and Logging_: Tools for tracking the performance and security of cloud applications (e.g., CloudWatch, ELK Stack).
