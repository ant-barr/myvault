### Summary

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts that enable efficient data storage, manipulation, and problem-solving. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing optimized and effective code, and they are widely used across various domains in computer science.

### Core Concepts

- **Basic Data Structures**:
    - _Arrays and Lists_: Sequential data storage methods.
    - _Stacks and Queues_: Linear structures for specific access patterns.
    - _Trees and Graphs_: Hierarchical and networked data models.
    - _Hash Tables_: Efficient data retrieval through key-value pairing.
- **Algorithm Design and Analysis**:
    - _Sorting Algorithms_: Techniques like bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort.
    - _Searching Algorithms_: Methods such as linear search and binary search.
    - _Recursion_: Functions that call themselves for problem-solving.
    - _Big O Notation_: Measuring and comparing algorithm efficiency.
    - _Dynamic Programming_: Solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
    - _Greedy Algorithms_: Making locally optimal choices for overall solutions.
