### Summary

Computer Architecture involves understanding the internal structure and functioning of computer systems. It covers how hardware and software interact, how data is processed, and how instructions are executed. Knowledge in this area is essential for optimizing software performance and understanding lower-level computing processes.

### Core Concepts

- **Digital Logic and Circuit Design**: Basics of how computers process binary information using logic gates and circuits.
- **Processor Design**:
    - _Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)_: Defines the set of operations a processor can perform.
    - _Microarchitecture_: Implementation of ISA in hardware.
    - _Pipelining_: Technique to improve CPU performance by executing multiple instructions simultaneously.
- **Memory Hierarchy**:
    - _Registers, Cache, RAM, and Secondary Storage_: Understanding different memory types and their roles.
    - _Memory Management_: How systems allocate and manage memory resources.
- **Input/Output Systems**: How computers interact with external devices.
- **Parallel Computing**: Techniques for processing multiple computations simultaneously.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics and methods to assess and improve system performance.
