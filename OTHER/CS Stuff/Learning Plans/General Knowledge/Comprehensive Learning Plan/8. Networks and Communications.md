### Summary

Networking and communications involve the study of how computers communicate with each other. This topic is crucial for understanding the internet, data transfer protocols, and the architecture of networked systems. Networking is foundational for cloud computing, distributed systems, and cybersecurity.

### Core Concepts

- **Networking Basics**:
    - _OSI Model_: The seven layers of network communication.
    - _TCP/IP Model_: Core protocols that power the internet.
    - _LAN, WAN, and MAN_: Different types of networks based on geography.
- **Network Protocols**:
    - _HTTP/HTTPS_: Web communication protocols.
    - _FTP, SMTP_: File transfer and email protocols.
    - _DNS_: Domain Name System for resolving human-friendly addresses.
    - _IP Addressing and Subnetting_: Assigning and organizing network addresses.
- **Routing and Switching**:
    - _Routers and Switches_: Devices that direct traffic within and between networks.
    - _Routing Protocols_: How routes are selected (e.g., OSPF, BGP).
- **Wireless Networking**:
    - _Wi-Fi_: Wireless networking standards and protocols.
    - _Bluetooth, NFC_: Short-range communication protocols.
- **Network Security**:
    - _Firewalls_: Protecting networks from unauthorized access.
    - _Encryption_: Securing data in transit.
    - _VPNs_: Virtual Private Networks for secure remote access.
- **Cloud Computing**:
    - _IaaS, PaaS, SaaS_: Different cloud service models.
    - _Virtualization_: Running multiple systems on a single physical machine.
    - _Containers_: Lightweight virtualization for deploying applications.
- **Advanced Topics**:
    - _Distributed Systems_: Coordinating work across multiple machines.
    - _SDN (Software-Defined Networking)_: Decoupling network control from hardware.
