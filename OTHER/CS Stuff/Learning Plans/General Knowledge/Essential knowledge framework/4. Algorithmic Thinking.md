### Summary

Algorithmic thinking is the process of solving problems using a series of well-defined steps or instructions. This skill is essential for creating efficient solutions in computer science.

### Core Concepts

- **What is an Algorithm?**: Understanding algorithms as step-by-step procedures to solve problems.
- **Pseudocode**: Writing algorithms in simple, human-readable instructions before coding.
- **Basic Algorithms**:
    - Simple algorithms for everyday tasks (e.g., finding the largest number in a list).
    - Understanding the importance of efficiency in algorithms.
- **Sorting and Searching**:
    - Introduction to basic sorting (e.g., bubble sort) and searching (e.g., linear search) algorithms.
- **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
