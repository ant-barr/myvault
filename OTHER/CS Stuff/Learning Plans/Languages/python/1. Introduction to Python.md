### Summary

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation. This section introduces the fundamentals of Python programming, laying the foundation for more complex topics.

### Core Concepts

- **Python Installation and Setup**:
    - Installing Python and setting up a development environment (e.g., Anaconda, VS Code, PyCharm).
    - Introduction to the Python Interactive Shell and using Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Basic Syntax and Structure**:
    - Writing and running Python scripts.
    - Understanding indentation, code blocks, and comments.
- **Variables and Data Types**:
    - Integers, floats, strings, booleans.
    - Type conversion and casting.
- **Basic Input and Output**:
    - Using `input()` for user input.
    - Printing output with `print()`.
- **Operators**:
    - Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
    - Operator precedence and associativity.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
    - Loops (`for`, `while`) and loop control (`break`, `continue`, `pass`).

### Study Plan

1. **Week 1**:
    - Install Python and set up your development environment.
    - Familiarize yourself with the Python interactive shell and Jupyter Notebooks.
    - Learn basic syntax, variables, and data types through simple scripts.
2. **Week 2**:
    - Practice input/output operations and learn about Python's various operators.
    - Study control flow using conditional statements and loops.
    - Write small programs to solidify your understanding (e.g., a basic calculator, a number guessing game).
