### Summary

Software engineering principles guide the development of maintainable, scalable, and efficient software. This section focuses on applying these principles in Python projects.

### Core Concepts

- **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**:
    - Phases of software development: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
- **Version Control**:
    - Using Git for tracking changes and collaborating on code.
    - Branching strategies and pull requests.
- **Design Patterns**:
    - Implementing common design patterns in Python (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).
- **Code Review and Refactoring**:
    - Best practices for reviewing code.
    - Refactoring techniques for improving code quality.
- **Agile Methodologies**:
    - Agile principles and practices.
    - Working with Scrum or Kanban.
- **Documentation**:
    - Writing clear and comprehensive documentation.
    - Using tools like Sphinx for generating project documentation.

### Study Plan

1. **Week 1**:
    - Study the software development life cycle and understand each phase.
    - Practice version control with Git: learn branching, merging, and pull requests.
2. **Week 2**:
    - Explore design patterns: implement common patterns in Python.
    - Review and refactor code to adhere to best practices.
3. **Week 3**:
    - Learn about Agile methodologies: study Scrum or Kanban and apply them in project management.
    - Participate in or simulate a sprint planning session.
4. **Week 4**:
    - Focus on documentation: write documentation for an existing project.
    - Explore tools like Sphinx for automating documentation generation.
