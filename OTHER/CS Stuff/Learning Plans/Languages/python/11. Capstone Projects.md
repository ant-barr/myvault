### Summary

Capstone projects allow you to apply all the concepts you've learned throughout your Python journey. These projects should be complex, involving multiple facets of Python programming, from data structures and algorithms to web development and machine learning.

### Project Ideas

- **Web Application**:
    - Develop a full-stack web application using Django or Flask.
    - Implement user authentication, a database backend, and a RESTful API.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
    - Analyze a large dataset using Pandas and NumPy.
    - Create visualizations and a report using Matplotlib/Seaborn and present your findings.
- **Machine Learning Project**:
    - Build and train a machine learning model on a real-world dataset using Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
    - Deploy the model as an API using Flask or Django.
- **Automation Tool**:
    - Create a Python script or application that automates a repetitive task (e.g., web scraping, data entry).
    - Integrate logging, error handling, and a simple user interface.
- **Game Development**:
    - Design and develop a simple 2D game using Pygame.
    - Implement game logic, scoring, and basic AI.

### Study Plan

1. **Week 1-2**:
    - Choose a project that aligns with your interests and goals.
    - Start with project planning: outline the features, design, and architecture.
2. **Week 3-4**:
    - Begin the development phase: write code, implement features, and regularly test your progress.
    - Seek feedback from peers or mentors to refine your project.
3. **Week 5-6**:
    - Focus on finishing and polishing the project.
    - Write comprehensive documentation, including setup instructions and usage guides.
4. **Week 7-8**:
    - Deploy your project if applicable (e.g., web app, machine learning API).
    - Present your project, highlighting the challenges faced and how you overcame them.
