### Summary

Functions and modules are essential in Python for organizing code into reusable and manageable pieces. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing clean, efficient, and scalable programs.

### Core Concepts

- **Functions**:
    - Defining and calling functions using `def`.
    - Function parameters and return values.
    - Scope and lifetime of variables (local vs. global).
    - Lambda functions for short, anonymous functions.
- **Modules and Packages**:
    - Importing standard and third-party modules using `import`.
    - Creating and using custom modules.
    - Organizing code into packages.
    - Using `pip` for installing external packages.
- **Built-in Functions**:
    - Exploring commonly used built-in functions (e.g., `len()`, `range()`, `sorted()`).
- **Decorators**:
    - Understanding decorators for modifying the behavior of functions.
    - Writing custom decorators.

### Study Plan

1. **Week 1**:
    - Learn how to define and call functions, including understanding parameters and return values.
    - Explore function scope and practice writing simple utility functions.
2. **Week 2**:
    - Study modules and packages: learn how to import and organize code.
    - Practice using standard libraries like `math`, `random`, and `datetime`.
    - Write custom modules and organize them into packages.
3. **Week 3**:
    - Explore lambda functions and decorators.
    - Practice writing functions with decorators to add functionality (e.g., timing functions).
