### Summary

Data structures are fundamental for organizing and storing data in Python. Mastery of Python's built-in data structures is essential for writing efficient and effective programs.

### Core Concepts

- **Lists**:
    - Creating and modifying lists.
    - List methods (`append()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, etc.).
    - List slicing and comprehensions.
- **Tuples**:
    - Creating immutable sequences.
    - Tuple packing and unpacking.
- **Dictionaries**:
    - Key-value pairs and dictionary methods (`get()`, `keys()`, `values()`, etc.).
    - Dictionary comprehensions.
- **Sets**:
    - Creating and modifying sets.
    - Set operations (union, intersection, difference).
- **Advanced Data Structures**:
    - Stacks and Queues using lists and `collections.deque`.
    - Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs (basic introduction).
- **Handling Iterators and Generators**:
    - Understanding iterators and creating custom iterators.
    - Using generators with `yield` for efficient looping.

### Study Plan

1. **Week 1**:
    - Study lists and tuples in detail: practice list operations, slicing, and comprehensions.
    - Explore tuple usage and practice unpacking.
2. **Week 2**:
    - Dive into dictionaries: learn how to create, modify, and iterate over dictionaries.
    - Practice set operations and understand where sets are useful.
3. **Week 3**:
    - Study advanced data structures: implement stacks and queues using lists.
    - Learn the basics of linked lists, trees, and graphs.
4. **Week 4**:
    - Explore iterators and generators: practice creating custom iterators and using generators.
    - Apply data structures to solve real-world problems (e.g., building a simple contact book, implementing a basic stack).
