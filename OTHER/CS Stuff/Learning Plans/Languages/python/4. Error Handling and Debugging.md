### Summary

Effective error handling and debugging are crucial for writing robust Python programs. Understanding how to anticipate, catch, and resolve errors ensures that your programs run smoothly and are maintainable.

### Core Concepts

- **Exceptions**:
    - Understanding Pythonâ€™s exception hierarchy.
    - Using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.
    - Raising exceptions with `raise`.
    - Custom exceptions: defining and using them.
- **Debugging Techniques**:
    - Using `print()` statements for basic debugging.
    - Introduction to the Python debugger (`pdb`).
    - Debugging in IDEs (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code).
- **Logging**:
    - Introduction to the `logging` module.
    - Configuring logging: levels, format, and handlers.
    - Using logging in larger applications.

### Study Plan

1. **Week 1**:
    - Learn about exceptions and how to use `try-except` blocks to handle errors.
    - Practice raising and handling custom exceptions.
2. **Week 2**:
    - Explore debugging techniques: start with `print()` debugging and move to using `pdb`.
    - Practice debugging a small project with common errors.
3. **Week 3**:
    - Study logging: configure the `logging` module for different scenarios.
    - Implement logging in a larger application to track events and errors.
