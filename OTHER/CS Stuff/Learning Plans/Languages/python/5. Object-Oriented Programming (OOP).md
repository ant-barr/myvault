### Summary

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm in Python that helps in organizing code into reusable and scalable components. Mastery of OOP principles is essential for designing complex software systems.

### Core Concepts

- **Classes and Objects**:
    - Defining classes and creating objects.
    - Instance variables and methods.
- **Encapsulation**:
    - Hiding implementation details using private attributes.
    - Using property decorators to manage access to attributes.
- **Inheritance**:
    - Creating subclasses and understanding method overriding.
    - Using `super()` to call parent class methods.
- **Polymorphism**:
    - Method overloading and overriding.
    - Interface design through abstract base classes (ABCs).
- **Special Methods**:
    - Implementing special methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.).
    - Operator overloading.
- **Design Patterns**:
    - Introduction to common design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).

### Study Plan

1. **Week 1**:
    - Learn the basics of classes and objects: practice defining classes and creating instances.
    - Explore instance variables and methods.
2. **Week 2**:
    - Study encapsulation: practice using private attributes and property decorators.
    - Learn about inheritance and polymorphism: implement simple inheritance structures.
3. **Week 3**:
    - Dive into special methods: understand how to override methods and use operator overloading.
    - Study and implement basic design patterns.
4. **Week 4**:
    - Apply OOP principles in a project: build a small application that utilizes classes, inheritance, and design patterns (e.g., a simple banking system or game).
