### Summary

Algorithms and problem-solving skills are crucial for writing efficient code and tackling complex programming challenges. This section focuses on developing these skills using Python.

### Core Concepts

- **Algorithmic Thinking**:
    - Breaking down problems into smaller, manageable components.
    - Designing algorithms to solve specific problems.
- **Search Algorithms**:
    - Linear search and binary search.
    - Search algorithms for graphs (DFS, BFS).
- **Sorting Algorithms**:
    - Implementing and understanding common sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort).
    - Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms.
- **Dynamic Programming**:
    - Understanding and applying dynamic programming to solve problems.
    - Memoization and tabulation techniques.
- **Recursion**:
    - Mastering recursion for problem-solving.
    - Identifying when recursion is appropriate and when it should be avoided.
- **Data Structure Algorithms**:
    - Implementing algorithms for common data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, trees).
    - Solving problems using data structures.

### Study Plan

1. **Week 1**:
