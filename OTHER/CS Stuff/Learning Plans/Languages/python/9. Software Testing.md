### Summary

Software testing ensures that your Python applications are reliable, bug-free, and meet the requirements. This section covers essential testing techniques and tools in Python.

### Core Concepts

- **Unit Testing**:
    - Writing and running unit tests using `unittest` and `pytest`.
    - Test-driven development (TDD) practices.
- **Integration Testing**:
    - Testing how different modules or services work together.
    - Using mock objects and dependency injection.
- **Automated Testing**:
    - Automating tests with tools like Selenium.
    - Continuous integration (CI) pipelines for automated testing.
- **Code Coverage**:
    - Measuring the extent to which code is tested using coverage tools.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**:
    - Writing tests in plain language using frameworks like `Behave`.
    - Aligning tests with business requirements.

### Study Plan

1. **Week 1**:
    - Start with unit testing: write basic tests using `unittest` and `pytest`.
    - Practice test-driven development by writing tests before code.
2. **Week 2**:
    - Explore integration testing: learn how to test interactions between different parts of an application.
    - Practice using mock objects and dependency injection.
3. **Week 3**:
    - Study automated testing: use Selenium to automate browser tests.
    - Learn about CI pipelines and integrate automated testing into a project.
4. **Week 4**:
    - Focus on code coverage: measure and improve test coverage using coverage tools.
    - Explore BDD: write behavior-driven tests using `Behave` and align them with user stories.
