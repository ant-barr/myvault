Local Government in Texas
--
Local governments have grown as the country has grown. As Americans settled in rural communities towns cities and suburbs they set up local governments 

- How are local governments established, and why are they needed?
- How is county government organized, and what are the main purposes of each level of country government?
- How do local and state governments work together?

Local Governments
- Are established by given powers from the state government
- Define their powers, responsibilities, and organization by charter from the state
- Provide services for citizens
- Maintain roads, running water, sewage systems, sidewalks, street cleaning and trash collection.
- Supervise privately owned electric and transportation systems

The country system of government in the United States:
- Borrowed from England, began in the southern agricultural states
- Scattered population gathered at the county seat to discuss issues.

Organization and purpose of country government:
- County board is elected by voters and forms the legislative body
- The country board supervises elections, enforces state laws; collects taxes; and provides health and welfare services, libraries, roads, and schools
- Country officials include sheriff and deputies, counter clerk, treasurer, auditor, and district attorney
- Some counties have elected a country manager and a county executive.

The Main Idea
	although counties are the largest unit of local government, they share the job of governing with other unites of local governments.
Focus
- Where did town governments begin, and what is the purpose of the town meeting?
- Why did townships and special districts develop, and how does each function?
- Why are villages and boroughs created, and how do they operate?

Town Governments
- Town governments began in the New England colonies
- Today, selectmen and selectwomen are elected to manage the towns affairs.
- Officials discuss the town business and a vote is taken on each item.
- Population growth has inhibited direct democracy
- Higher populations require more local services
- Town managers and representative town meetings have developed

Townships
- First type developed in the Middle Atlantic States; maintained roads and schools and assisted the poor.
- Second type: divisions of land in the Midwestern states that were developed by Congress in 1785 as part of a surveying system

Special Districts
- Developed to serve special needs of an area
- The most numerous form of local governments
- Operated by a commission

Villages and Boroughs
- Created when populations grow and need to organize 
- Self-governing municipalities
- Collect taxes and provide local services
- Governed by a council with an executive (Mayor)

The Main Idea
	A city is usually larger than a town or village. In many cities a large population is crowded into a relatively small area, which creates many challenges for city governments.
Focus
- How are city governments organized under the home rule system?
- What are the different forms of city government?

Cities
- Are larger than other local governments.
- Often have large populations crowded into a small area
- Must deal with education, health, safety, transportation, sanitation, water supply, and fire and police protection

City Governemnts
- Established by and receive charters from state legislatures
- Some cities have been granted home rule and can write their own charters
- Home rule cities manage their own affairs.
- Some states limit the independence of their cities' government

Different type of city governments and their function?
- ===Mayor council government===: mayor prepares the budget, proposes laws, and appoints officials; city council passes laws and approves the mayors appointments cities have weak mayor plans and strong mayor plans.
- ==Commission Government===: board of commissioners passes laws and carries out the function of government.
- ===Council-Manager Government===: city council passes laws and appoints the city manager who proposes laws and appoints department heads.

How are city Governments Established
- Charter granted by the state governemtn
- The state gives the city permission to write its own charter under home rule

The Main Idea
	you live under three levels of governments - local, state, and federal. Without cooperation among these levels, everyday life would not run smoothly.
Focus
- How do the different levels of government work together?
- How do governments cooperate to meet peoples needs?
- In what ways are different levels of government in competition?

Division of powers among levels of government;
- Local, state, and federal governments have clearly defined powers.
- Each level of government has the power needed to do its job.
- All levels of government obey the U.S. Constitution.
  The federal system keeps the powers of each level clearly defined.

The federal government is involved in building roads.
- Roads were originally local projects.
- As the county grew, Congress voted to federally fund roads connecting the east to the west
- Late 1800s - state funds first use to manage local roads
- Interstate highway system is a joint effort of state and federal governments.
- Good roads contribute to the safety and well-being of all citizens.

Government functions requiring the cooperation of different levels of government:
- Public education - funds and services from the state; schools controlled by local boards; special funds form the federal government
- Federal Bureau of Investigation and the local and state police-work together and share state crime laboratories
- Stores and businesses - state licensing boards ensure quality local services; grants-in-aid and block grants given to state and local governments from federal government
